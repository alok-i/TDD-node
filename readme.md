# Add Method Function with Jest Tests

This project contains a JavaScript/TypeScript function called `add` that handles different string formats and returns the sum of the numbers in the string. The function supports features like:

- Handling any number of numbers.
- Handling new lines (`\n`) as delimiters between numbers.
- Supporting custom delimiters.
- Throwing an exception for negative numbers.

The project includes Jest test cases to ensure that the function works as expected.
